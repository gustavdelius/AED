#' Vicente et al. (2006) analyzed the distribution on tuberculosis-like lesions in wild boar (\emph{Sus scrofa}) for
#' potential importance of persistence of tuberculosis in south central Spain. Data came from harvested animals.
#' Tuberculosis (Tb) is a zoonosis that can jump from non-human to human animal, which makes the disease interesting to
#' study for its economical and public health impacts.
#' 
#' The dataset comes with variables:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item Tb: An integer denoting presence (1) or absence (0) of tuberculosis in an animal
#'     \item sex: Sex of the animal harvested
#'     \item age_class: Age class of the animal based on tooth eruption patterns. Boars less than 7 months old were
#'     classified as piglets, boars between 7 and 12 months were classified as weaners, those between 12 and 24 months
#'     as juveniles, and those more than 2 years old as adults.
#'     \item length_ct: Head-body length of the animal in cm, where CT is Spanish abbreviation for \emph{cabeza-tronco}.
