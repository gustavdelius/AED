\usage{
data("BadgerActivity")
}
\description{
Longitudinal badger activity data from several farms from 2003-2005.
}
\details{
Longitudinal data of badger (\emph{Meles meles}) activity from 36 farms in eight consecutive occassions from 2003 to 
2005. All farms were located in South-West England, known for its high badger activity. Badgers are known to be a
a vector for spreading tuberculosis which is why humans (\emph{Homo sapiens}) have a keen interest in studying them
as they can have public health and economic impact on humans and livestock.

Some of the original variable names have been renamed (i.e. Year -> year) for consistency. Variables in the dataset 
are:

\itemize{
  \item year: Calendar year
  \item season: Spring (Mar-May), summer (Jun-Aug), autumn (Sept-Nov), winter (Dec-Feb)
  \item farm_code: Blinded farm identifier
  \item survey: Which of the eight survey occasions (i.e. the time indicator)
  \item signs_in_yard: Binary indicator of signs of badger activity
  \item latrines_with_farm_feed: Binary indicator - do (any) observated badger latrines contain farm feed? This is
  proxy for the fact that badgers must have been on the farm.
  \item no_latrines_with_farm_feed: The number of the above
  \item no_scats_with_farm_feed: Number of badger scats identified as containing farm feed
  \item no_latrines: Number of badger latrines observed
  \item no_setts_in_fields: Number of badger setts (i.e. homes) observed
  \item no_active_setts_in_field: Number of actively used setts observed
  \item no_buildings: Number of buildings on farm
  \item no_cattle_in_buildings_yard: Number of cattle housed in the building yard
  \item mode_feed_store_accessibility: Quantitative index of how easy it would be for badgers to access farm's feed 
  store
  \item accessible_feed_store_present: Binary indicator - is such a feed store present?
  \item mode_cattle_house_accessibility: Quantitative indicator of how easy it would be for badgers to access the 
  cattle house
  \item accessible_cattle_house_present: Binary indicator - is cattle house present?
  \item accessible_feed_present: Binary indicator - is accessible food present?
  \item grass_silage: Binary indicator of presence of grass silage
  \item cereal_silage: Binary indicator of presence of cereal silage
  \item hay_straw: Binary indicator of presence of hay or straw
  \item cereal_grains: Binary indicator of presence of cereal grains
  \item concentrates: Binary indicator of presence of concentrates
  \item protein_blocks: Binary indicator of presence of protein blocks
  \item sugar_beet: Binary indicator of presence of sugar beet
  \item vegetables: Binary indicator of presence of vegetables
  \item molasses: Binary indicator of presence of molasses
